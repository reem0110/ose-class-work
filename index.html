    <h1> WHAT IS REBASE</h1>
    <h2>git rebase is a command for merging two branches into one <br>
    <h2>the 'git rebase' command rewrites the whole history of your projects commits and instead of 'merging' a branch into another by creating a new commit it allows you to have a much cleaner commit history<br></h2>
    <h2> differences between rebase and merge is that when you use the merge command it creates a merge commit while rebase dosen't and when you use rebase it creates a brand new commit for each commit you've done in your branch
    </h2></div>


    <div class="fetch">
        <h1>WHAT IS FETCH</h1>
        <h2>The 'git fetch' command is used for fetching(downloading) files, commits and refs from a remote repository to your own repository it simply just updates your local repository with the latest changes that were made to the remote repo<br></h2>
        <h2>The differences between 'git fetch'and 'git pull' are that 'git pull' copies everything from a remote repository directly to your "working directory"/branch while 'git fetch' just updates to your local repository </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="workflow">
        <h1>WHAT IS WORKFLOW</h1>
        <H2>workflow is a recommandation(set of rules) of how to complete a project in a team. In a workflow no one commits changes directly to the main branch but rather commit everything in the "develop" branch while having other feauters branches.<br> when the project is ready you need to create a new branch named "release" to test and fix any bugs. <br>when everything on the "release" branch becomes ok we merge the "release" branch back to the "develop" branch  </H2>
